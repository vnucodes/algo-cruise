# Algo Cruise
My journey in learning algorithms and DSA by solving various problems.
Problems are mostly taken from Leetcode and the solutions are developed by me.
Of course these solutions can be better!! and they will get better, it's just matter of time.

### Problems
- [Median of two sorted array](https://github.com/vnucodes/algo-cruise/blob/master/problems/Median-of-Two-Sorted-Arrays.js)
- [Two Sum](https://github.com/vnucodes/algo-cruise/blob/master/problems/Two-Sum.js)
- [Longest palindromic substring](https://github.com/vnucodes/algo-cruise/blob/master/problems/Longest-Palindromic-Substring.js)
